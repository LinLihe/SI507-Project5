    I am accessing the Twitter search API and gathering:
    - 20 Tumblr text blogs for each of 2 users I'm going to search for
    - For each blog, I'll be accessing the the post date, post url, tags and the summary
    - I'll write 2 CSV files (named by their blog name), one for each blog-identifier's search
    - Data in each CSV file: 4 columns -- time posted, url posted, blog's tags and summary
    - URL for the API (which also includes the description of authentication process for the API): https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#auth
